1) Explain how a typical HTTP request is processed with the framework (the request lifecycle)
	First the browser needs to translate the URL to an IP address. If it does not know it, it contacts a DNS server to resolve the name.
	Then the browser will open a TCP connection to the IP address and send a HTTP GET request over.
	The server software will get this HTTP request. It will somehow generate a HTTP response and send that back trough the TCP connection. 
	How the server does this is server software dependent.
	When the browser gets the response, it typically renders it on screen. The HTTP request is now done.

2) Why should GET requests be idempotent?
	Idempotent: Get always the same result with multiple requests.
	When you use GET, nothing should be changed on the server. When you use POST, you add additional data to the server and a new request
	wouldnt deliver the same. So POST isnt idempotent, on the contrary to GET.

3) Where should you format data for rendering?
	The data should be formated in a css file! So the whole design-part is separeted. It can also be formated in the template (haml).
